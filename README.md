# Celebrity Face Recognition WebApp
![index](index.gif)<br/>

We classify sports personalities in this data science and machine learning study. We limit the number of people who can be classified to only five. In this model, we first gathered photographs of athletes from the internet, then used OpenCV to crop all of the faces found in the images. The photos were then Wavelets converted to extract the primary characteristic of the faces. The data was then trained using a training set. We explored a number of algorithms before settling on SVM because it produced the best results. Then, as a backend, we built a flask application to handle the input and output.
